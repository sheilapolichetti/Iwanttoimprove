# Iwanttoimprove
I started this because I had a thought of making a sort of automated self-care/self-improvement site called "Iwanttoimprove", where you go and select what you are feeling that day and what you want to improve/practice on, such as a page to find healthy eating habits/recipes for omnivores, vegetarians, vegans, or a page with some simple exercise routines to feel better, or simply just a page where you can watch TONS of feel good/makesmehappy videos to cheer up. :) Proejct got put on hold because of studies, a move and work but I plan to getting to it eventually!
